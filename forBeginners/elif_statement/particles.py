# The world of elementary particles is rather complex. There are many 
# different classes and they can interact in a rather interesting way.
#
# Two important characteristics of the elementary particles are the spin 
# and the electric charge. Here are some of the elementary particles:
#
#   Particle	Class	    Spin	Electric charge
#   Strange	    Quark	    1/2	    -1/3
#   Charm	    Quark	    1/2	    2/3
#   Electron	Lepton	    1/2	    -1
#   Neutrino	Lepton	    1/2	    0
#   Photon	    Boson	    1	    0
#  
# Write a program that returns the particle and its class based on its spin and electric charge.
#
# The input format:
#   Two lines: first the spin of the particle, then its charge. 
#   You do NOT have to convert these values to floats.
#
# The output format:
#   The particle and its class separated by a space.

# Locate a point on the Cartesian coordinate plane: 
# which of four quadrants does a point belong to?
#
# Read two numbers from the input, not necessarily integers, the first number 
# will indicate a position on the X-axis, the second one â€” on the Y-axis. 
# Let's keep referring to the quadrants by Roman numerals, as detailed:
#       I   = X > 0, Y > 0
#       II  = X < 0, Y > 0
#       III = X < 0, Y < 0
#       IV  = X > 0, Y < 0
#
# If a point is the origin (0, 0), print "It's the origin!". In case of a 
# point lying on the axes, with either x = 0 or y = 0, 
# print "One of the coordinates is equal to zero!".

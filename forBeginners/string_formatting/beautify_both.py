# The output should be user-friendly, but the code part is also important. 
# Well-structured and readable code is very important for being a good 
# programmer. Now it's up to you to decide, which formatting method to choose.
#
# Imagine you need to compose a dynamic URL for every certain user with 
# user-specific details. Suppose, you want to send different URLs for every 
# user, depending on their name and profession. 
# The base would be something like
#
#       "http://example.com/*nickname*/desirable/*profession*/profile"
#  where nickname and profession are prompts from a user and are dynamic.
#
# Read the nickname and profession of the user from the input and print a 
# user-specific URL. Don't bother about any rules of composing the URLs and 
# just use raw input to accomplish the task.

# ****** PYTHON - Naming Variables : Fix str ******

# The previous developer accidentally named a variable str. Since this name is 
# reserved for a built-in type, now the code fails.

# Please fix the variable name by adding an underscore, as suggested in the 
# topic. The value of your new variable shouldn't change, i.e. it should look 
# like Hello10. You don't have to print anything.

# Remember that the str() function returns the string version of the given object.
# *************************************************

# str = "Hello"
# str = str + str(10)

str_ = "Hello"
str_ = str_ + str(10)

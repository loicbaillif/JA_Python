# Since we are learning Python, sometimes it might be useful to convert text 
# from lowerCamelCase to snake_case. The main trick is to find the correct 
# place where to insert an underscore. Let's make a rule that an underscore 
# should be inserted right before a capital letter, so lowerCamelCase would 
# become lower_camel_case.
#
# The input format:
#   Read a word or a phrase written in lowerCamelCase
#
# The output format:
#   Print out words in lowercase and separate them by underscores.

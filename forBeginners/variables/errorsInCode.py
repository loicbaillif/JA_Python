# ****** VARIABLES - Exercise : Errors in code ******

# Imagine your friend has created a code for checking the type of 
# variable (ost = 'Happy'), but you have found some errors in it. Help him: 
# find two or three errors, correct the code and print 
# the type of the variable.

# Original file:
# ost = Happy <== Typo : missing quote marks
# print(type_of(0st)) <== Typo :0 instead of o - Typo 2 : type, not type_of

ost = "Happy"
print(type_of(ost))

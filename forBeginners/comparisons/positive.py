# Basic Data Types and Operations #
# Comparisons #
# Write a program that reads an integer value from the input and checks 
# if it is positive.
#
# Hints: 
# 0 is not a positive number.
# A comparison already returns a boolean, so if you need the result of the 
# comparison, you can print it, like this print(5 > 9) # False

print(int(input("Please enter an integer value:\n-> ")) > 0)

# ****** PROJECT ZOOKEEPER : Stage 2 - Show me an anymal ******

# Description :
# One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye 
# on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are 
# doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an 
# animal! 
# 
# Objectives :
# For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. 
# Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

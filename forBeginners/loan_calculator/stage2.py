# DESCRIPTION
# Let's consider 0% interest loans. We will also round all monthly payment, to 
# get rid of cents.
# It is also important to remember that no payment can be more than the fixed 
# monthly payment.

# OBJECTIVES
# The behavior of your program should look like this:
#       - Prompt a user to enter their loan principal and choose which of the 
#       two parameters they want to calculate â€“ the number of monthly payments 
#       or the monthly payment amount.
#       - To perform further calculations, you'll also have to ask for the 
#       required missing value.
#       - Finally, output the results for the user.

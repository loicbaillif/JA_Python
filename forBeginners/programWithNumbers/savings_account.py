# ****** Exercise : Saving Accounts ******
#
# For the given amount of money, calculate the income from this 
# savings account with a 5% interest rate after one year.
# 
# Here's the formula for calculating the income: 
# income = (amount * interest * years) / 100 
# 
# Save the result into the variable income. You DO NOT need to print it.

amount = 1000
interest_rate = 5
years = 1
# change the next line
to_percent = 100
income = (amount * interest_rate * years) / to_percent

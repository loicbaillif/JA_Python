# Lucy is drawing a poster with English contractions for her students. 
# We will join her English club and help with learning materials.
#
# Print the following strings with contractions:
#   - I am = I'm
#   - I have = I've
#   - I will = I'll
#   - I had / would = I'd
# Each string should be on a new line. This will be easy 
# if you use quotes wisely.

print("I am = I'm")
print("I have = I've")
print("I will = I'll")
print("I had / would = I'd")

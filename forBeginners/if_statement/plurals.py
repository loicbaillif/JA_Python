# Alex wrote a program that reads a number and a word from the input to 
# create phrases like "3 cats" and "1 dog". Unfortunately, the condition for 
# plural nouns is currently missing. Alex doesn't know how to use if 
# statements, but you do. Help Alex complete this program.
# 
# The plural form of a word generally ends with s. All numbers, apart from 1, 
# expect the plural form after them, even zero: "0 birds".
#
# Words that form their plural not by adding s, will NOT appear in the tests.

number = int(input())

# write a condition for plurals

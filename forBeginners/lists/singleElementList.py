# ****** LISTS - Exercise : Single element list ******
#
# Helen wants to create a list containing only one element â€“ a string with 
# her name. To do this, she wrote this line of code:

#     name = list('Helen')

# However, when she prints the list, her name appears broken into 
# several one-letter strings:

#     print(name)
#     # ['H', 'e', 'l', 'e', 'n']

# Why? Fix this code.

name = ['Helen']
print(name)

# A regular octahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape, a polyhedron 
# with eight equal faces and twelve equal edges. Have you ever seen 8-sided 
# dice? That's a regular octahedron. In this task you need to calculate its 
# area and volume.
#
# Write a program that reads a positive integer representing the edge length 
# of the regular octahedron and prints two values â€“ its area and volume 
# (in that order), both rounded to 2 decimal places and split by one space.
#
# Formula to calculate the area of an octahedron (a is edge length):
#   2 * sqrt{3} * a ^ 2
#
# Formula to calculate the volume:
#   (1/3) * sqrt{2} * a ^ 3
